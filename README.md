My name is Matthew Solc. I am a graduate of Skyline High School in Longmont. I was in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Academy. The summer of Freshman year I completed my ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) Certification and Sophomore summer I re-certified with ACMT and ACiT (Apple Certified iOS Technician). Skyline did not offer many automotive classes, so all my experience is self taught.  

I am interested in working in Computer Science and Software Development. I have learned several programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, and C++. I have learned the Linux Command Line and am very comfortable using it. I have set up my own systems using Arch Linux and Gentoo. 

I am also interested in working in the automotive world. I have become very self reliant when it comes to cars. My first car, a 2007 Saab 93, fell victim to a strong rainstorm and suffered engine flooding. I was able to fix it after clearing out the intake, cylinders and exhaust. I also installed a new starter which in a Saab, is no small feat. I came across a second car, a 2005 Acura TL, which I have been putting work into non stop. Cold air intake, new alternator, new brake rotors, calipers, and pads. I also have done CV axles and radiators, intake manifolds and valve covers. I am very hands on with my vehicles and am never going to stop learning new things.

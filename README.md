My name is Matthew Solc. I am a Junior at Skyline High School in Longmont. I am in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Academy. The summer of Freshman year I completed my ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) Certification and Sophomore summer I re-certified with ACMT and ACiT (Apple Certified iOS Technician). 

I am interested in working in Computer Science and Software Development. I have learned several programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, and C++. I have learned the Linux Command Line and am very comfortable using it. I have set up my own system using Arch Linux. I am always looking to learn new things and new ways to apply my current skills.

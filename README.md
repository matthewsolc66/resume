My name is Matthew Solc. I am a graduate of Skyline High School in Longmont. I was in the STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) Academy. The summer of Freshman year I completed my ACMT (Apple Certified Mac Technician) Certification and Sophomore summer I re-certified with ACMT and ACiT (Apple Certified iOS Technician). Skyline did not offer many automotive classes, so all my experience is self taught.  

I am interested in working in Computer Science and Software Development. I have learned several programming languages, including Python, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, and C++. I have learned the Linux Command Line and am very comfortable using it. I have set up my own systems using Arch Linux and Gentoo.
